description = "A2C, or Advantage Actor Critic, is a synchronous version of the A3C policy gradient method. As an alternative to the asynchronous implementation of A3C, A2C is a synchronous, deterministic implementation that waits for each actor to finish its segment of experience before updating, averaging over all of the actors."
