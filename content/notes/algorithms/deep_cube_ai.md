description="DeepCubeAI is an algorithm that learns a discrete world model and employs Deep Reinforcement Learning methods to learn a heuristic function that generalizes over start and goal states. We then integrate the learned model and the learned heuristic function with heuristic search, such as Q* search, to solve sequential decision making problems."
