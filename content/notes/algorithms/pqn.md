description="PQN is a parallelized version of the Deep Q-learning algorithm. It is designed to be more efficient than DQN by using multiple agents to interact with the environment in parallel. PQN can be thought of as DQN (1) without replay buffer and target networks, and (2) with layer normalizations and parallel environments."
