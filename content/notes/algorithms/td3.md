template = "resources/algorithm.html"
description = "TD3 builds on the DDPG algorithm for reinforcement learning, with a couple of modifications aimed at tackling overestimation bias with the value function. In particular, it utilises clipped double Q-learning, delayed update of target and policy networks, and target policy smoothing."
