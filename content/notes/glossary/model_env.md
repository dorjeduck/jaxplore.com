A model of the environment is a function which predicts <a href="#state">state</a> transitions and rewards. One of the most important branching points in an RL algorithm is the question of whether the agent has access to (or learns) a model of the environment.  Algorithms which use a model are called model-based methods, and those that donâ€™t are called model-free. 

* **Pros of Model-Based Methods**:
    * Enables agents to simulate potential outcomes before acting
    * Allows strategic thinking and systematic option evaluation
    * Improves decision-making efficiency
    * Can substantially enhance sample efficiency
* **Cons of Model-Based Methods**:
    * Ground-truth environmental models are rarely available
    * Requires learning models purely from experience
    * High risk of model bias leading to suboptimal real-world performance
    * Model-learning is inherently challenging
    * Significant time and computational investment may not yield results
