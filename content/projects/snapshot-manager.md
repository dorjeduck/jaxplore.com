[Snapshot Manager](https://github.com/dorjeduck/snapshot-manager) is a lightweight and versatile tool for managing Python objects, allowing users to create isolated snapshots or manage live references, both enriched with metadata and tags.

[https://github.com/dorjeduck/snapshot-manager](https://github.com/dorjeduck/snapshot-manager)

Initially created with JAX PyTrees in mind, it works seamlessly with a wide range of Python object. A specialized PyTreeSnapshotManager is included for PyTree-specific operations, but its features are still limited and evolving.

A reinforcement learning related use case can be found [here](https://github.com/dorjeduck/snapshot-manager/blob/main/use_case_rl.md).
