description = "Deep Learning with JAX teaches you to build effective neural networks with JAX. In this example-rich book, you’ll discover how JAX’s unique features help you tackle important deep learning performance challenges, like distributing computations across a cluster of TPUs. You’ll put the library into action as you create an image classification tool, an image filter application, and other realistic projects. The nicely-annotated code listings demonstrate how JAX’s functional programming mindset improves composability and parallelization."
